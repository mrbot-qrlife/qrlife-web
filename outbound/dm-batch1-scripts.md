# Viking Voyage 2026 — Batch #1 DM Scripts (IG first → X fallback)

Always include your QRLife creator card in the second message once they respond positively (or after the first reply).

## Universal DM #1 (intro)
Hey {Name} — I’m Chris (MrChrisDoesStuff). I’m planning a year‑long RV loop in 2026 (“Viking Voyage 2026”) and I’d love to do a super simple collab when I’m near you (30–60 min, I handle filming/editing, you get clips too). Open to it?

## Universal DM #2 (QRLife card)
Also— I can make you a free QRLife creator card that links to all your official socials (one QR → everything). If you want, I’ll send it over and tweak anything.

## 48–72h follow‑up
Quick bump—if you’re up for it I’ll coordinate dates as the route firms up. And if you want the QRLife creator card either way, I’m happy to send it.
