# Makerspace outreach playbook (Viking Voyage 2026)

## What to ask when contacting (copy/paste checklist)
1) **Visitor access**
- Do you allow **non-members** to visit/shop? If yes: how (open house, tour, member sponsor)?
- Is there a **day pass** / guest fee? What’s included?
- Are **minors** allowed with parent/guardian? Any age limits?

2) **Safety/orientation requirements**
- Is an **orientation** required before using tools? How long? Can we schedule it same-day?
- Are specific tools gated by **certifications** (laser, CNC, woodshop, welding)?

3) **Tooling + project fit**
- Do you have: laser cutter (size/watt), CNC (router/mill), 3D printers (filament/resin), woodshop, metalshop/welding, electronics bench (soldering, scope), textiles?
- Consumables policy: can visitors bring materials? Do you sell stock?

4) **Hours + staffing**
- Best time for a tour? Are there staffed hours vs 24/7 members?
- Any blackout dates/events we should avoid?

5) **Content/collab permission** (if filming)
- Are photos/video allowed? Any signage or consent needs?
- Can we do a **meetup/talk** for members/community? Capacity and AV?

6) **RV & parking logistics**
- Is there parking for a **truck + trailer** nearby (even if not on-site)?
- Any height/overnight restrictions?
- Recommended nearby **state park/fairgrounds/boondocking** options?

7) **Contact + paperwork**
- Best contact person + email/phone.
- Any waivers to sign ahead of time?

## Typical access models (what to expect)
- **Open-to-public shop**: day passes common; easier scheduling; often tool-library style.
- **Members-only, but tours welcome**: use open house nights; a member host/sponsor may be required.
- **Fab Lab (university/library)**: great equipment; hours may be limited; may require reservation/training.

## Good asks/offers (in exchange)
- Offer a short **show-and-tell** (what you’re building on the road).
- Offer to run a **mini workshop** (3D printing basics, CAD, etc.) if you have a repeatable topic.
- Offer publicity: blog/IG/YT mention, link back, and a post-event recap.

## Red flags / gotchas
- Tool use requires **multiple separate certifications** → plan 1–2 days if you actually need to make parts.
- Parking: urban locations may be impossible for RV; plan **base camp outside city**.
- Some orgs are volunteer-run; response times can be slow. Use Meetup/Discord channels when listed.
