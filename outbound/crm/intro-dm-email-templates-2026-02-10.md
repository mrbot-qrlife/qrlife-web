# QRLife Sponsor Outreach Templates (2026-02-10)

## 1) Short DM (Instagram/X)
Hi {{first_name_or_brand_team}} — I’m MrChris from QRLife + Viking Voyage 2026.

We’re building a verified QR profile system that helps people avoid fake links/profiles, and we can pre-build a branded QR card for your team, then transfer ownership to you with a private claim code.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute chat about a sponsorship/collab?

What we can offer:
- Branded QR card setup done-for-you
- Co-branded campaign content from the road
- Real performance stats (scans, visits, claims)

If yes, I’ll send a 1-page concept + sample card link.


## 2) Medium DM (Creator/Partnership Team)
Hey {{name}} — MrChris here.

I’m on the Viking Voyage 2026 project and building QRLife, a safer QR/profile platform. We create verified QR cards for creators/brands, send a private claim code, and your team takes ownership instantly.

I’d love to partner with {{brand}} and feature your products/services across our road-content series.

Proposed collab:
- We build your branded QR card first (no setup burden on your side)
- You claim ownership with a secure code
- We publish campaign content and track real usage metrics

Can I send over a 1-page sponsorship outline + a live sample card?


## 3) Email Intro
Subject: Partnership idea for {{brand}} + QRLife verified QR rollout

Hi {{name/team}},

I’m MrChris, founder building QRLife and leading Viking Voyage 2026.

I’m reaching out with a partnership idea: we can pre-build a branded QR card for {{brand}}, then send a private claim code so your team can take ownership and manage it immediately.

Why this is useful:
- Helps reduce clone/impostor profile confusion
- Gives your audience a trusted destination QR
- Provides measurable campaign stats (scans, visits, claims)

We’d like to combine this with content from our Viking Voyage 2026 route and feature {{brand}} in a practical, real-world way.

If this sounds relevant, I can send:
1) a one-page partnership outline,
2) a live sample QR card,
3) suggested campaign formats.

Thanks,
MrChris

## 4) Follow-up (3–5 days later)
Hi {{name}} — quick follow-up in case this got buried.

Still happy to spin up a branded QR card draft for {{brand}} and share a private claim code so your team can take it over instantly.

Want me to send a sample?


## 5) Claim-code handoff message (after interest)
Awesome — your branded QR card draft is ready.

Claim URL: {{claim_url}}
Claim code: {{claim_code}}

Use this to take ownership on qrlife.me, then you can update profile content anytime and view usage stats.

If you want, I can also set up your first campaign tracking tags before handoff.
