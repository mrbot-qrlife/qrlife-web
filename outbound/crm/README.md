# CRM (local)

This folder is the source-of-truth CRM for:
- sponsors/brands
- people-to-meet ("100 list")
- events/stops

Send updates via WhatsApp in plain text (or voice). I will append/normalize into these CSVs.

## Files
- `sponsors.csv`
- `people.csv`
- `events.csv`

## Status conventions
- Sponsors: Prospect | Contacted | Warm | Negotiating | Won | Lost | Parked
- People: Target | Reached Out | Response | Scheduled | Met | Parked
- Events: Planned | Booked | Attending | Covered | Skipped
