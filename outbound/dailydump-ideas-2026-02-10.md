"Quick founder update: QRLife is getting a hard reset. I’m keeping current production stable, but we’re launching a new web alpha so real users can test what matters. We’re restoring our QR type system, adding campaign tracking, and making scan-to-claim measurable. March 1 is our target. If you want early access, DM me ‘BETA’ and I’ll send you in."
