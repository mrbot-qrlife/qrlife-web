## Context

- Owns an app called qrlife.me (QRLife).
- QRLife includes scam-safety features, including scanning a QR code’s URL to detect whether it points to a malicious/bad-actor website.
- QRLife does not auto-open scanned websites; it shows you the link first, then you can choose to open it or save it.
- QRLife QR cards (direct-to-profile links) help avoid impostor/clone profiles because the QR points to the verified, real QRLife profile URL rather than a lookalike found via search.

*(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)*

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
