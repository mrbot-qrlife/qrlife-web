## Setup / Context
- WhatsApp gateway connected.
- Bootstrapped identity + preferences:
  - User: Chris ("MrChris")
  - Assistant: lilchris 😎
  - Default vibe: chatty + collaborative
- Enabled git author for workspace commits:
  - user.name = MrChris
  - user.email = mrchris@local

## Log
- 02:28 EST: User: “Wake up, my friend!”
- 02:29–02:33 EST: Collected naming + vibe preferences; saved to USER.md / IDENTITY.md; committed bootstrap.

## Notes / TODO
- Start and maintain a daily log in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md.
- QRLife scam-safety: scans a QR code’s URL to detect whether it points to a malicious/bad-actor website.
- QRLife scam-safety: does not auto-open scanned URLs; shows the link first so the user can choose to open it or save it.
- QRLife scam-safety: QRLife QR cards can link directly to the real profile URL, reducing risk of landing on impostor/clone profiles found via search.
