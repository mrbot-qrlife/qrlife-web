# 2026-02-03

- Continued planning Viking Voyage 2026 route and wrote route draft to: outbound/route/viking-voyage-2026-route.md.
- Set up Samba share sync for OpenClaw workspace:
  - Share path: /home/mrchris/share (share name in smb.conf: [mrchris-share])
  - Mirror destination: /home/mrchris/share/openclaw-workspace/
  - Sync script: ~/.local/bin/openclaw-sync-share (rsync mirror, writes /tmp/openclaw-sync-share.log)
  - Daily cron: 23:15 America/New_York → runs openclaw-sync-share

Route constraints locked:
- Lower 48 only in 2026; back to FL for New Year’s 2027.
- Clockwise, weather-first.
- Avoid RV in big cities; RV base camp + flat-towed Honda CRV day trips (~2h each way).
- Prefer state parks, state fairgrounds, Harvest Hosts/boondocking.
- Event focus: regional events with big events when not out of the way; stay longer on event weekends.
- Add fish expos + reptile expos; include Tinley Park (NARBC) aligned to Midwest pass; detour tolerance up to ~4 hours.
- Must-hit stops: Mobile AL, Austin TX (Mothership + Bambu), OutpostX (Beryl UT), Clint’s Reptiles (Springville UT), Snake Discovery (WI/MN), Peoria IL (John Pratt), Tinley Park IL (NARBC), Utica MI (LegaSea/The Reptarium).

- User wants the assistant to remember a theme/goal: raising money for the home operations: crypto farm, fish farm, solar farm.

TODO next:
- Continue harvesting influencers batch and email first 20 to MrChris@mrchrisdoesstuff.com.
- Layer event radar onto the route; add candidate events to outbound/crm/events.csv.
- Start Tinley vendor-list monitoring and prep badge-vendor CSV export workflow.
- Research funding/tax-credit/grant options relevant to solar + aquaculture + (possibly) crypto mining business.
