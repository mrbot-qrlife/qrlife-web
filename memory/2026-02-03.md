- Continued planning Viking Voyage 2026 route (clockwise, weather-first). Constraints:
  - Lower 48 only in 2026; back to FL for New Year's 2027.
  - Avoid driving RV into big cities; park RV as a base and use flat-towed Honda CRV for day trips.
  - CRV day-trip radius ~2 hours each way.
  - Prefer state parks, state fairgrounds, Harvest Hosts/boondocking.
  - Event focus: regional events with big events when not out of the way; stay longer on event weekends.
  - Add fish expos + reptile expos; include Tinley Park (NARBC) aligned to Midwest pass; detour tolerance up to ~4 hours.
- Added OutpostX (sci-fi glamping) in Beryl, UT (near Zion) to events CRM.
- Built/updated CRM:
  - outbound/crm/influencers.csv created (1k–10k US creators, active last 30 days; RV first, tech second).
  - Imported user-provided route-priority 'people to meet' list into outbound/crm/people.csv.
  - Confirmed: keep John Pratt + LegaSea/The Reptarium team even though not in subscriptions list.
- Noted QRLife links:
  - q8a2d67 = QRLife socials card; q5f662d = app download landing.

TODO next:
- Continue harvesting influencers batch and email first 20 to MrChris@mrchrisdoesstuff.com.
- Produce first full month-by-month route skeleton + start layering event radar.
- Start Tinley/NARBC date/vendor-list monitoring and prep vendor badge CSV export workflow.
