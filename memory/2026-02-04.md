# 2026-02-04

- MrChris started a plan to record a nightly "daily dump" video (5–10 min max) covering what he did today + plan for tomorrow; wants verbatim transcripts so OpenClaw stays in sync.
- Today: worked with OpenClaw (import/contact-route work), did 3D prints (mostly printer upgrades), started thinking about printing QR code/QR-related items, and worked on streaming setup.
- Tomorrow plan: foot doctor appointment; hopefully get cleared to be fitted for a shoe and start walking again (after ~6 years off and on). Goal is to get back to normal to build out a camper datacenter for the Viking Voyage 2026 trip.

TODO next:
- Update CRM influencers batch with IG/X/contact routes and generate paste-ready DM scripts (intro + QRLife card follow-up + 48–72h bump).
- Keep refining Viking Voyage 2026 route + event radar layering.
