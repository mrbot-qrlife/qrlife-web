## Daily dump workflow
- MrChris started recording nightly 5–10 min "Daily Dump" videos and wants:
  - verbatim transcript
  - platform-ready titles/descriptions/keywords/hashtags (FB, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, X)
- Always include hashtags: #VikingVoyage2026 #QRLifeme #MrChrisDoesStuff
- Daily dump (Feb 4, 2026) transcript saved to: outbound/dailydump-2026-02-04-verbatim.txt

## Outreach workflow
- Use CRM and prioritize IG DM → X DM (verified) → email/contact form.
- Batch #1 contact routes populated in outbound/crm/influencers.csv.
- DM scripts saved in outbound/dm-batch1-scripts.md.

## Makerspaces plan
- MrChris wants to visit makerspaces across the US during Viking Voyage 2026 as a "pit crew" + community feature.
- He is a member of FamiLAB (familab.org) in Orlando.
- Tool requirements are flexible.
- Primary goal: tours/meet people/document spaces + promote the makerspace community.
- Secondary goal: occasional scheduled upgrades/repairs with willing members.

## Sponsors / upgrades ideas (new)
- Down4Sound (Las Vegas HQ) — want them to do car + camper sound; track their events.
- Vatrer Power (LiFePO4) — user’s current battery upgrade; wants to meet/shop visit; track events.
- UniFi/Ubiquiti — networking + cameras sponsor for camper datacenter.
- Camper upgrade sponsor categories to pursue: hard-shell roof product, air ride suspension, captain chairs, dual AC upgrade, center management console, whole-camper monitoring via Home Assistant.
- Micro Center sponsor idea: makerspace + Micro Center meetups; potential kit collab for air quality sensor project.
- Jeff Geerling: user wants to copy/build his air quality meter project for the camper; potential kit partnership idea.

## Reminders scheduled
- Daily 11:00 PM: record + send Daily Dump video.
- One-shot: update Etsy store backgrounds + train Becky on making backgrounds (Midjourney or Banana) + decide whether to cancel Midjourney.

TODO next:
- Verify/enrich makerspace seed list: confirm websites + best contact routes; add lat/lon; replace ND/SD placeholders.
- Track Down4Sound + Vatrer events calendars and match to route; add key events to outbound/crm/events.csv.
- Add sponsor candidates for camper upgrades (suspension, seating, HVAC, HA/power) and research US factory/HQ + install-tour possibilities.

- Camper: 2016 Thor Challenger 37KT (Class A)
- Chassis: Ford F53 (confirmed by user)
- Upgraded: new Onan 5kW generator
