## Daily dump workflow
- MrChris started recording nightly 5–10 min "Daily Dump" videos and wants:
  - verbatim transcript
  - platform-ready titles/descriptions/keywords/hashtags (FB, YouTube, TikTok, LinkedIn, X)
- Always include hashtags: #VikingVoyage2026 #QRLifeme #MrChrisDoesStuff
- Daily dump (Feb 4, 2026) transcript saved to: outbound/dailydump-2026-02-04-verbatim.txt

## Outreach workflow
- Use CRM and prioritize IG DM → X DM (verified) → email/contact form.
- Batch #1 contact routes populated in outbound/crm/influencers.csv.
- DM scripts saved in outbound/dm-batch1-scripts.md.

## Makerspaces plan
- MrChris wants to visit makerspaces across the US during Viking Voyage 2026 as a "pit crew" + community feature.
- He is a member of FamiLAB (familab.org) in Orlando.
- Tool requirements are flexible.
- Primary goal: tours/meet people/document spaces + promote the makerspace community.
- Secondary goal: occasional scheduled upgrades/repairs with willing members.

## Hardware / merch
- Bambu P1S arrived; plan is to bring it in the camper to print upgrades and potentially sell items via Etsy.

## Reminders scheduled
- Daily 11:00 PM: record + send Daily Dump video.
- One-shot: update Etsy store backgrounds + train Becky on making backgrounds (Midjourney or Banana) + decide whether to cancel Midjourney.

TODO next:
- Verify/enrich makerspace seed list: confirm websites + best contact routes; add lat/lon; replace ND/SD placeholders.
- Produce month-by-month "near route" makerspace list + outreach message template for tour/meetup.
